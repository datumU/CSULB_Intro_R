## Exercise
+ How would you find the height of the tallest person in the room?
+ Let's write an algorithm with instructions on how to do so.
    + List the necessary inputs
    + Describe how to take those inputs and return the height of the tallest person

    
## Algorithm: Find the Height of the Tallest Person in the Room
**Input:** List of heights of people in the room, $H = [height_1, height_2, \ldots]$

**Output:** Height of the tallest person in the room, $tallest$

$tallest = height_1$

for each $item$ in $H$, do

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if $item > tallest$, then

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $tallest = item$

return $tallest$
