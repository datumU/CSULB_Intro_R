## Introduction
Practice subsetting the data frame you created in Exercise 2!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
name <- c("Sally", "Michelle", "Lupe", "Wendy", "Maritza",
          "Jorge", "Sam", "Joe", "Glenn", "Buck")
female <- c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, 
            FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)
edu <- c("HS", "BS", "BS", "MS", "PhD", 
         "HS", "HS", "BS", "MS", "PhD")
salary <- c(30, 38, 53, 65, 89, 29, 33, 42, 107, 246)

data <- data.frame(name = name,
                   female = female,
                   edu = edu,
                   salary = salary)

data$name <- as.character(data$name)
data$female <- as.numeric(data$female)
data$edu <- factor(data$edu, levels=c("HS", "BS", "MS", "PhD"), ordered=TRUE)
```


## Part A

Open the R script that you used for Exercise 1, and re-run the code there to ensure that ```data``` is loaded into your current environment. Check that this worked properly by typing ```data``` and ```str(data)``` at the prompt and inspecting the output.
